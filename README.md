# Basic information

The purpose of this project is nothing more than to learn the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm for which I am using the python programming language due to its friendly syntax, therefore I am using the integrated library Tkinter and Mysqlite3 for handling of the Database.

It is a project that (just maybe) exports to other platforms and makes the program better structured, with better implementation of the libraries and with better code writing practices.

I apologize if you find some Spanish words in the code, I am a Spanish speaker and it is for my comfort, from now on I will adapt it to English so that it is readable by the majority, the changes will be from the next commit.

The project is an online chat application made in Linux with a basic CRUD, which at the moment does not work (ðŸ˜…), I spent some time studying databases, I broke my brain implementing it and it did not work after many attempts, I will continue working on it . á•™(`â–½Â´)á•—

Now without further ado I will show you my progress on the project and explain the places where they are written in Spanish.

Mainly a simple menu window with respective buttons to open the Login window and Registration window with a welcome message.

Here is the Login window with a text that says "Enter your data" with an input for the username and password, below a button that will validate the user and then open the chat window.

I do not put the registration window since it inherits from this Login window, as you will see, everything is simple and poor.

And this is the most important window, the chat window, don't pay much attention to the name above, it just occurred to me ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°), I had (and still have) doubts regarding its design, I did it In this way, after searching for inspiration on the internet, my idea is to make it retro and simple in this version of Linux.

Something similar to msn for windows or those old web chats that almost no longer exist, it only has two panels and an input for messages, I am collecting information to give it all the functionality it requires to be a "perfect" chat although I know give it some functions, the truth is I don't know what exactly to put in it yet (ðŸ˜…)

Soon I will know more exactly, I am doing different surveys on various social networks.


That's all for now, more updates to come, Thanks for reading!
